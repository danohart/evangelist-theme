  <h2><i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i>Beliefs</h2>
  
<h3>1.THE BIBLE</h3>
<p>I believe the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments to be the inspired Word of God, inerrant, complete and final revelation of God’s will to man, and the supreme standard to all faith and life. (Isaiah 40:8; 2 Timothy 3:16, 17; John 10:35; 2 Peter 1:19-21). We believe the King James Bible, AV 1611, to be the inerrant Word of God, providentially preserved and transmitted to the people of our time. We believe it is unique in its unerring portrayal of the exact rendering of the original Text, and that it reigns Supreme, having no rival among all English Translations of the world. We do not believe there is any need to revise, update, correct, better explain, or change in any way, the present King James Bible, AV 1611.</p>

<h3>2.GOD</h3>
<p>I believe in one God, omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent, manifesting himself in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; one in nature, attributes, power, and glory. (Genesis 1:1; Mark 12:39; Matthew. 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14; John 1:1-4, 14; John 5:17-27; Philippians 2: 6-11).</p>

<h3>3.JESUS CHRIST</h3>
<p>I believe that the Lord Jesus Christ was begotten by the Holy Spirit, born of the virgin, Mary, and that He is true God and true man. (Matthew 1:18-25; Luke 1:26-35; John 1:1-4,14; John 5:17-27; Philippians 2:6-11).</p>

<h3>4.MAN</h3>
<p>I believe that man was created in the image and likeness of God, that he sinned, and thereby incurred not only physical death, but also spiritual death, which is separation from God; that all human beings are born with a sinful nature and are sinners in thought, word, and deed. (Genesis 1:26; 2:7-9,16,17; 3:1-9; Psalm 14:3,4; 51:5; 58:3; Romans 5:12; Ephesians 2:1-3).</p>

<h3>5.SALVATION</h3>
<p>I believe that the Lord Jesus Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures as a substitutionary sacrifice, and that all who believe on Him are justified on the ground of His shed blood on the cross, and are saved by grace through faith, wholly apart from human merit and works. (John 1:29; Acts 13:38, 39; 16:31; Romans 3:21-28; Ephesians 2:8-10, Titus 3:3-8).</p>

<h3>6.REGENERATION</h3>
<p>I believe that all that repent and receive the Lord Jesus Christ by faith are born again by the Holy Spirit through the Word of God, and thereby become children of God. (John 3:3-8, 14-16, 1:12, 13,5:24; 10:28,29; 1 Peter 1:23; 2 Peter 1:4-7; 1 John 3:1-3).</p>

<h3>7.THE HOLY SPIRIT</h3>
<p>I believe that the Holy Spirit is a divine person, and the administrator of the things of God: convincing of sin, revealing Christ, teaching the truth, restraining evil, energizing believers in prayer, worship and service, and is ever present in the believer as our comforter and helper. (Psalm 139:7-12; John 7:38,39; 15:26; 16:13, 14; Acts 1:8; Romans 8:9; 1 Corinthians 6:19; 2 Thessalonians 2).</p>

<h3>8.SATAN</h3>
<p>I believe in the reality and personality of Satan: that he is a created being of beauty and power, the prince of this world, the god of this age, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience; that he fell through pride, and that he will be judged and cast into the lake of fire. (Ezekiel 28:12-18; Isaiah 14:12-14; Job 1:6, 7; John 8:44; Ephesians 2:2; 2 Corinthians 4:4, 11, 13-15; Revelation 20:1-3, 7-10).</p>

<h3>9.THE RETURN OF CHRIST</h3>
<p>I believe in the resurrection of the crucified body of our Lord, His ascension into Heaven, His present life there for us as our High Priest and Advocate, and His personal, bodily, visible, pre-millenial return to establish His kingdom on earth, to reign as the only potentate: the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. (Luke 24:26-43; John 20:24-29; Acts 1:9, 10; 1 Corinthians 15:20-25; 1 Timothy 6:14, 15; Revelation 1:7; 19:11-16; 20:6).</p>

<h3>10.THE RAPTURE OF THE SAINTS</h3>
<p>I believe in a pre-tribulation rapture… that at any moment the rapture of the saved may occur, when the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven. . . .” to catch up His people to meet Him in the air; and so shall we ever be with the Lord. (John 14: 1-3; 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18; 1 Corinthians 15:51-58).</p>

<h3>11.HEAVEN AND HELL</h3>
<p>I believe in the bodily resurrection of all the dead: the saved, to a life of eternal glory and bliss in heaven with God; the unsaved, to eternal judgment of conscious suffering and woe in the lake of fire. (John 5:28-29; Revelation 20:6, 11-15,21:1-8; Matthew 10:28, 18:8-9,25:41 and 46; Mark 9:43-49; 2 Thessalonians 1:6-9).</p>

<h3>12.EVANGELISM</h3>
<p>I believe that it is the privilege and responsibility of every believer to be a personal soul winner and to do his utmost to give the Gospel of Christ to the whole world. (Mark 16:15-16; Acts 1:8; Matthew 4:19; John 17:18,20:21 and 2 Corinthians 5:20).</p>

<h3>13.SEPARATION</h3>
<p>I believe that we are called to be a separated people to abide in Christ, to walk in the Spirit and to enjoy victory over the world, the flesh and the devil. (Romans 12:1-2; Galatians 5: 16; 1 John 2:15- 17; Colossians 3:1-17 and 2 Corinthians 2:14).</p>

<h3>14.ORDINANCES</h3>
<p>I believe that there are two ordinances of the Church Baptism by immersion and the Lord’s Supper. Baptism is to be administered to believers only, and the Lord’s supper to be administered to the church membership. (Mark 16:16; Acts 2:38; 1 Corinthians 11:23-32 and Matthew 3:16).</p>

<h3>15.ETERNAL SECURITY</h3>
<p>I believe that all who have truly been born again by the Spirit of God through faith in Christ are eternally secure. Our security rests in the finished work of Jesus Christ, and that all the redeemed are kept by God’s power and are thus secure in Christ forever. (John 10:20-29, 5:24; 2 Timothy 1:12; Philippians 1:6 and Romans 8:33-39 John 3:16; 1 John 5:12).</p>

<h3>16.THE CHURCH</h3>
<p>I believe that the local, New Testament church is the only institution established by God to fulfill the great commission. The work of the church is to preach and teach the word, seek lost souls, assemble together for mutual profit, give to the cause of Christ, pray as a church, send missionaries, serve God faithfully and let the light of Christ shine through us to the world.</p>
